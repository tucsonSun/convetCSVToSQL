        notice the DriveTime advantage over local Buy Here Pay Here lots immediately, from
        our helpful website which provides you the option to choose your path to financial
        approval or vehicle searching, all the way through the car-buying experience at

    <h3>
        DriveTime is the largest used car dealer helping people with credit issues.</h3> 
    <p>
        Buy Here Pay Here dealers can''t offer the customer service and support that DriveTime
        offers. We offer 24/7 support hotlines and customer service, no matter the question
        or problem at hand. We also don''t follow the embarrassing Buy Here Pay Here model
        of constant in-store payments. We''ll help you get approved, treat you fairly and get 
        you into a high quality used vehicle.</p>
    <h3>
        Buy Here Pay Here? DriveTime? What''s the big difference?</h3>
    <p>
        Let''s start with the quality of cars you''ll find on our lots. Where Buy Here Pay
        Here dealers usually sell 5+ year old cars with over 100,000 miles on the clock,
        we sell later model cars with less mileage than the competition. Beyond that, all
        cars you see at our dealerships have been through our detailed multi-point inspection
        (something Buy Here Pay Here''s rarely offer) ensuring that you are buying a car
        that will be a reliable long-term investment in your mobility.</p>
    <h3>
        Now the icing on the cake? Introducing the DriveTime Difference:</h3>
    <p>
        Not only is the car you''ll be buying a quality used car, but we also offer our 
        DriveCare package: 3 year / 36,000 mile vehicle coverage. That''s not all either; at
        DriveTime you''ll get an AutoCheck vehicle history report to ensure your peace of mind.

        Search our online inventory and see the vehicles for yourself. Other dealers typically
        offer customers with bad credit vehicles older than ours and with more mileage.
        This means that the life of the vehicle you may be buying will be less, leaving
        you with expensive repairs. If you have bad credit and are looking for a car loan,
        the choice is simple... DriveTime.

    <h3>
        Need a car and don''t have any credit history?</h3>
    <p>
        DriveTime offers cars to people across the nation with no credit history. We have
        93+ locations nationwide with over 5000 vehicles available for you to choose from.
        DriveTime offers unbeatable financing options for people with no credit that other 
        dealerships just can''t compete with. We approve customers with no credit history every day. 
        No Credit approvals are as simple as a visit to
        our local DriveTime dealership. No Credit Auto Financing is really that
        simple with DriveTime.</p>
    <h3>
        Why buy from DriveTime instead of buy private party with a no credit car loan?</h3>
    <p>
        Private party cars may seem less expensive than DriveTime cars, but the savings & experience
        we provide more than make up for the difference in price. The experience
        that you''ll receive throughout the DriveTime approval and car shopping process will
        be positive and simple. The freedom of choice is another benefit of DriveTime over
        other dealerships and no credit car loan providers. Once you are approved, you will
        have several vehicles to choose from that will fit your personal needs. Car
        loan lenders also heavily penalize borrowers with no credit history. Beware of short-term
        obligations and outrageous terms that may increase the likelihood of defaulting
        on a car loan and negatively affecting your credit score. All of our vehicles are
        thoroughly tested and must pass a multi-point inspection before they are delivered
        to a DriveTime dealership, but this is just the beginning of the benefits DriveTime
        offers.Another benefit is our industry-leading DriveCare package: a 3 year / 36,000 mile 
        vehicle coverage. Plain and simple: if you have no credit and need a
        car loan, DriveTime is your best option.</p>
    <h3>
        Car loan approval with no credit history</h3>
    <p>
        No credit is not bad credit. Don''t accept to be treated differently because you
        do not have credit history. DriveTime does not make
        you feel different from any other vehicle owner. You''ll get the same treatment and you''ll
        get great auto financing options for you approval. Other auto dealers simply cannot offer these
         great options to no credit history buyers.</p>
    <h3>
        Better Vehicles. Newer Models. Less Mileage. Multi-point Inspected.</h3>
    <p>
        Search our online inventory and see the vehicles for yourself. Other dealers typically
        offer customers with no credit history vehicles older than ours and with more mileage.
        This means that the life of the vehicle you may be buying will be less, leaving
        you with expensive repairs. If you have no credit and are looking for a car loan,
