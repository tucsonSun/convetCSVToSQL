        DriveTime is not your typical ""Buy Here Pay Here"" Dealership!</h3>
    <p>
        It is our mission to provide customers with credit problems a second chance to own
        a quality used car, truck or SUV, no matter how poor their credit situation. You?ll
        notice the DriveTime advantage over local Buy Here Pay Here lots immediately, from
        our helpful website which provides you the option to choose your path to financial
        approval or vehicle searching, all the way through the car-buying experience at
        one of our local dealerships!</p> 
    <h3>
        DriveTime is the largest used car dealer helping people with credit issues.</h3> 
    <p>
        Buy Here Pay Here dealers can?t offer the customer service and support that DriveTime
        offers. We offer 24/7 support hotlines and customer service, no matter the question
        or problem at hand. We also don?t follow the embarrassing Buy Here Pay Here model
        of constant in-store payments. We'll help you get approved, treat you fairly and get 
        you into a high quality used vehicle.</p>
    <h3>
        Buy Here Pay Here? DriveTime? What?s the big difference?</h3>
    <p>
        Let?s start with the quality of cars you?ll find on our lots. Where Buy Here Pay
        Here dealers usually sell 5+ year old cars with over 100,000 miles on the clock,
        we sell later model cars with less mileage than the competition. Beyond that, all
        cars you see at our dealerships have been through our detailed multi-point inspection
        (something Buy Here Pay Here?s rarely offer) ensuring that you are buying a car
        that will be a reliable long-term investment in your mobility.</p>
    <h3>
        Now the icing on the cake? Introducing the DriveTime Difference:</h3>
    <p>
        Not only is the car you?ll be buying a quality used car, but we also offer our 
        DriveCare package: 3 year / 36,000 mile vehicle coverage. That?s not all either; at
        DriveTime you?ll get an AutoCheck vehicle history report to ensure your peace of mind.
         Buy Here Pay Here lots can?t touch this.</p>

    <h3>
        Need auto financing and have bad credit history?</h3>
    <p>
        DriveTime offers auto financing to people across the nation with bad credit. We
        have 93+ locations nationwide with over 5000 vehicles available for you to choose
        from. DriveTime offers unbeatable auto financing options for people with bad credit 
        history that other dealerships just can't compete with. Bad Credit approvals are 
        as simple as a visit
        to our local DriveTime dealership. Bad Credit Auto Financing is really
        that simple with DriveTime.</p>
    <h3>
        Why buy from DriveTime instead of buy private party with bad credit auto financing?</h3>
    <p>
        Private party autos may seem less expensive than DriveTime cars, but the savings & experience
        we provide more than make up for the difference in price. The experience
        that you?ll receive throughout the DriveTime approval and car shopping process will
        be positive and simple. The freedom of choice is another benefit of DriveTime over
        other dealerships and bad credit auto financing lenders. Once you are approved,
        you will have several vehicles to choose from that will fit your personal needs.
        Auto financing lenders also heavily penalize borrowers with bad credit. Beware of
        short-term obligations and outrageous terms that may increase the likelihood of
        defaulting on your auto financing and negatively affecting your credit score. All
        of our vehicles are thoroughly tested and must pass a multi-point inspection before
        they are delivered to a DriveTime dealership, but this is just the beginning of
        the benefits DriveTime offers. Another benefit is our industry-leading DriveCare package: 
        3 year / 36,000 mile vehicle coverage. Plain and simple: if you have bad credit
        and need auto financing, DriveTime is your best option.</p>
    <h3>
        Auto Finance approvals with bad credit history</h3>
    <p>
        Bad credit doesn?t mean the end of the world. Don?t accept to be treated differently
        because you have  a bad credit history. DriveTime does not
        make you feel different from any other vehicle owner. You'll get the same treatment and you'll get
        great auto financing options for your approval. Other auto dealers simply cannot offer 
        these great options to bad credit history buyers.</p>
    <h3>
        Better Vehicles. Newer Models. Less Mileage. Multi-point Inspected.</h3>
    <p>
        Search our online inventory and see the vehicles for yourself. Other dealers typically
        offer customers with bad credit history vehicles older than ours and with more mileage.
        This means that the life of the vehicle you may be buying will be less, leaving
        you with expensive repairs. If you have bad credit and are looking for auto financing,
        the choice is simple? DriveTime.</p>

        Private party autos may seem less expensive than DriveTime cars, but the savings and 
        experience we provide after the sale more than make up for the difference in price. 
        The experience
        that you?ll receive throughout the DriveTime approval and car shopping process will
        be positive and simple. The freedom of choice is another benefit of DriveTime over
        other dealerships and no credit auto financing lenders. Once you are approved, you
        will have several vehicles to choose from many that will fit your personal needs.
        Auto financing lenders also heavily penalize borrowers with no credit history. Beware
        of short-term obligations and outrageous terms that may increase the likelihood
        of defaulting on your auto financing and negatively affecting your credit score.
        All of our vehicles are thoroughly tested and must pass a multi-point inspection
        before they are delivered to a DriveTime dealership, but this is just the beginning
        of the benefits DriveTime offers. Another benefit is our industry-leading DriveCare package: 
        3 year / 36,000 mile vehicle coverage. Plain and simple: if you have
        no credit and need auto financing, DriveTime is your best option.</p>
    <h3>
        Auto Finance approvals with no credit history</h3>
    <p>
        No credit is not bad credit. Don?t accept to be treated differently because you
        do not have credit history. DriveTime does not make you feel different from any other vehicle
         owner. 
        You'll get the same treatment and you'll get a great car load & financing options. No other
         no credit car load providers can offer the same options and experience.

        Better Vehicles. Newer Models. Less Mileage. Multi-point Inspected.</h3>
    <p>
        Search our online inventory and see the vehicles for yourself. Other dealers typically
        offer customers with no credit history vehicles older than ours and with more mileage.
        This means that the life of the vehicle you may be buying will be less, leaving
        you with expensive repairs. If you have no credit and are looking for auto financing,
        the choice is simple? DriveTime.</p>
